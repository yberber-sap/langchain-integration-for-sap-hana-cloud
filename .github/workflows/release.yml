      # We want to keep this build stage *separate* from the release stage,

      # The release stage has trusted publishing and GitHub repo contents write access,
      # and we want to keep the scope of that access limited just to the release job.
      # Otherwise, a malicious `build` step (e.g. via a compromised dependency)
      # could get access to our GitHub or PyPI credentials.
      #

      # > It is strongly advised to separate jobs for building [...]
      # > from the publish job.

      # We explicitly *don't* set up caching here. This ensures our tests are
      # maximally sensitive to catching breakage.
      #
      # For example, here's a way that caching can cause a falsely-passing test:
      # - Make the langchain package manifest no longer list a dependency package
      #   as a requirement. This means it won't be installed by `pip install`,
      #   and attempting to use it would cause a crash.
      # - That dependency used to be required, so it may have been cached.
      #   When restoring the venv packages from cache, that dependency gets included.
      # - Tests pass, because the dependency is present even though it wasn't specified.
      # - The package is published, and it breaks on the missing dependency when
      #   used in the real world.
